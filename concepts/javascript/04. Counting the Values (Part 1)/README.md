####Javascript Number
1. JavaScript numbers follow the rules of floating point math. Their decimal part offers more precision closer to 0, and less precision further away from it. We can say that their decimal point is “floating”.
2. Numbers resulting from invalid math operations like 1 / 0 or 0 / 0 are special. NaN is one of such special numbers.
3. typeof(NaN) is a number because it is a numeric value. It’s called “Not a Number” because it represents the idea of an "invalid" number.
